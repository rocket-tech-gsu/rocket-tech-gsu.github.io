In order to purchase large and powerful rocket engines capable of delivering
payloads to high altitudes, we need certifications from the National
Association of Rocketry (NAR).
These NAR High Power Rocketry (HPR) certifications are granted on a per-person
basis, so we need to acquire each level of these certifications several times
over.
That is, we will certify a particular once per launch (hopefully not per
several launches) so that several members of Rocket Tech GSU have the ability
to oversee high-power rocket launches and purchase the necessary engines.
You can read some basic details about NAR's HPR certifications
[here](https://www.nar.org/high-power-rocketry-certifications/).

There are three levels to the HPR certification process; we're planning to
complete all three levels in time for some competitions in Winter 2024-2025.
- We are aiming for a late March launch for the HPR Level 1 certification in
  Georgia.
- We would like to perform an attempt at attaining the Level 2 certification by
  the end of this Spring 2024 semester.
- At least one club member should obtain an HPR Level 3 certification by
  the end of October 2024.

Obtaining all of the NAR HPR certifications is a crucial first step towards
establishing Rocket Technologies GSU as an upcoming competitor in national
rocketry competitions.
These frequent, small successes will serve to develop momentum for our
organization and demonstrate to prospective sponsors that we are serious,
capable rocketeers.
Thus, it is absolutely vital that we prioritize this goal during our first year
of operation.
